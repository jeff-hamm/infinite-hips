Opioid Education

-Opioids are often prescribed to help provide pain relief in the early postoperative
period.

-Please note that we take great care with pain med prescriptions (opioids) and want you
to be aware that the use of opioids can lead to addiction and overdose, depending on
amountused and duration of use. This risk is increased in persons who suffer from
mental illness and/or substance use disorders. Also taking opioids in conjunction with
benzodiazepines, sleep aids, muscle relaxants, alcohol, recreational drugs, or other
sedatives increases the risk of sedation and respiratory depression which can have
consequences as significant as death.

-We advise patients to completely wean off of opioids once they are near the one month
post op mark after their surgery, as it is not recommended to be on opioids for long
periods of time.
