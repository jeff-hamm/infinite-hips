2 YEARS OF ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS AFTER TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENT

For protection against the remote possibility of blood-bome bacteria, carried from the mouth during a dental procedure.
creating an infection in a total joint replacement, a combined task force of American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons
and the American Dental Association has made the following guideline recommendations:

1. Following total joint replacement, all patients are advised to take an antibiotic regimen for 2 years when
undergoing dental procedures such as:

e Prophylactic cleaning of teeth or implants
¢ — Intraligamentary local anesthetic injections
* Periodontal procedures
e Root canal procedures

« Dental extractions

* Dental implant procedures

e Implantation of avulsed teeth

e Initial placement of orthodontic bands

2. Lifetime antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is recommended for patients considered at a higher risk:
* Solid organ transplant
« Rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatologic conditions affecting the immune system
* Diabetics |
« Smokers
¢ Chronic renal disease
« BMI >40
* Patients taking disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, biologics, steroids. or chemotherapy

3. The recommended antibiotic regimen (if not allergic to penicillin) is:
¢ Amoxicillin, Cephalexin (e.g. Keflex), or Cephradine two (2.0) grams orally one (1) hour prior to the dental
procedure.
4. For patients with a penicillin allergy. the updated recommended antibiotic regimen is:

* Doxycycline (e.g. Vibramycin) 100 mg, or Azithromycin (e.g. Zithromax) 500 mg orally one (1) hour prior
to the dental procedure.

5. Do not go to the dentist for 3 months after surgery unless it is an emergency. ff you have a dental emergency,
please call our office, in addition to your dentist, and let us know.

6. Call your surgeon's office when you will be going to the dentist to receive an antibiotic prescription, or your dentist
may also prescribe an antibiotic for you.

7. The above recommendations are considered minimum guidelines. Your doctor and/or dentist are ultimately
responsible for making individual treatment recommendations to you based on their clinical judgment.
