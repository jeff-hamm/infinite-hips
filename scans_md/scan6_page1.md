Constipation

Constipation is the infrequent or difficult passage of hard stool, which often causes pain and
discomfort.

Diet: You should increase the amount of high fiber foods. Eat fresh raw fruits with skins and
seeds, fresh raw vegetables, bran, and drink fruit juices (like prune juice). Warm or hot fluids in
the morning are especially helpful. Increase fluid intake overall to help prevent dehydration.

Stool softeners: (Colace) Help to lubricate the intestine so that stool can pass through more
easily. They do not chemically stimulate the bowel and are used primarily to prevent
constipation.

Laxatives: Chemically stimulate the bowel causing it to move faster. These are products such
as Miralax, Milk of Magnesium, Dulcolax tablets, Magnesium Citrate, etc. Be careful not to take
too much as they. can cause diarrhea.

Suppositories: Chemically or physically stimulate the bowel. They work best within % hour
after a meal.

Enemas: Physically stimulate defecation by flushing out the area. Fleets enemas usually work
well and are easy to give. Enemas are only given when everything else has failed, and if
overused can cause “addiction” in which you will be unable to have a bowel movement without
an enema.

If taking a narcotic, please follow this regimen:

1. Begin taking Colace or Senakot. Take one tablet by mouth twice a day with plenty of
water.

2. If you have not had a bowel movement by the second day, continue with #1 and take
one capful of Miralax every morning.

3. If you have not had a bowel movement by the third day, continue with #1 and #2, and
take a Dulcolax suppository, one rectally, every 12 hours.

4. If you still have not had a bowel movement after the above treatment, continue with #1,
#2 and #3, and take one full bottle of Magnesium Citrate, undiluted.

5. If all of these measures have failed to induce a bowel movement, call your surgeons
Office.

If you develop loose, frequent, or watery bowel movements, reverse these steps
