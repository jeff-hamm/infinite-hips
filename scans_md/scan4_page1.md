GAME G2 READY?

The Game Ready® GRPro® 2.1 system features innovative, patented ACCEL® Technology
(Active Compression and Cold Exchange Loop), enabling the integrated delivery of continuous
cold and intermittent pneumatic compression therapies. The portable GRPro 2.1 has set a new
standard in non-narcotic musculoskeletal injury pain relief and accelerated healing.

The Advantages of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression and
Cryotherapy Treatment for Post-Operative Patient Care

Going beyond passive, static cold and compression applications, the
GRPro 2.1 therapy system works actively and dynamically to
accelerate and enhance recovery. Game Ready’s anatomic,
circumferential wraps envelope the surgery site and then conform to
the.contours of the body with pneumatic compression, assuring better
surface contact and thus more effective cooling. Game Ready
provides faster, deeper, and longer-lasting therapy than most other
products.

Intermittent pneumatic cryo-compression shortens recovery timelines
and improves patient's pain and discomfort after surgery without the
harmful effects of medications. Game Ready’s Active Compression
and Cold Exchange Loop provides the therapeutic power to enhance lymphatic function, encourage
blood flow, and stimulate tissue healing.

The GRPro 2.1 features pre-set programs and easily customize compression levels, temperature, and
time settings with the touch of a button or the turn of a dial. These pre-set programs allow cryotherapy
treatment even during sleep with programmed 30 minute treatment cycles.

We prescribe the Game Ready system because we want you to have the best recovery experience as
possible. Most private insurance plans do not cover Game Ready or other cold therapy products. While
the Game Ready System will certainly assist in your recovery, please remember that it is your choice
whether or not to use the system. The rental cost of the unit is $325 for two weeks ($23/day). Additional
weeks are $150/week. Typically, surgical procedures use the Game Ready for 2-3 weeks; we have
seen it make a big difference in patient’s recoveries. Patient satisfaction levels with Game Ready are
over 91% experiencing a more comfortable and faster recovery, and 87% reduced the amount of pain
medication they took or enabled them to stop taking meds sooner.

if you choose to order Game Ready for use after your surgery, please contact the local Game Ready
rep at least one week prior to your surgery date to schedule delivery and training a few days before

your surgery.
