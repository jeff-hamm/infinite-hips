Returning to work: The decision to return to work will be based on the type of work you do, your physical
Stamina, and whether you have other medical conditions. This time period can be anywhere from 1-3 months

following the procedure. We recommend that you avoid making any major changes in your work or retirement
plans until your recovery is complete.

Precautions: No hyperextension or external rotation of the surgical hip for three months post-op

Traveling/Flying: Traveling for a long period time can increase your risk for developing blood clots. It is
recommended to AVOID domestic flights for 6 weeks and international flights for 3 months after joint
replacement surgery. Long drives are OK if you take frequent breaks (one per hour) to stretch and take
steps. Please check with Dr. Wilde regarding travel and when it is safe to do so.

COMMON PROBLEMS

e Leg & ankle swelling: You may have some swelling in your operated leg that should gradually decrease. If
swelling occurs, lie down, elevate your legs above the level of your heart, and rest.

¢ Pain: Pain may be a result of over-activity. When you are in pain, sit or lie down, elevate your legs, and

rest. If the pain does not subside, take the pain medication prescribed for you. Painis a protective mechanism
that helps to prevent over-usage and should not be ignored.

¢ Difficulty sleeping: Most patients report more pain night than during the day; resulting in difficulty sleeping.
You may try Tylenol PM or Melatonin at bedtime if this occurs.
