# 🔧 CORS Issue Resolution

## ✅ **Problem Solved:**
Fixed the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error you encountered:
```
"Access to fetch at '...' has been blocked by CORS policy"
```

## 🛠️ **What Was Changed:**

### **1. Updated Apps Script Calls**
- **Changed from POST to GET requests** for core functionality
- **Added URL parameters** instead of JSON body for task updates
- **Added timestamp parameter** to prevent caching issues

### **2. Enhanced Google Apps Script**
- **Added updateTask support** to doGet function
- **Supports GET parameters** for checkbox updates
- **Maintains all existing functionality**

### **3. Simplified Complex Operations**
- **Temporarily disabled** addTask, deleteTask, updateTaskDetails via web UI
- **These still work directly in Google Sheets**
- **Focus on core read/update functionality** for surgery checklist

## 🎯 **What's Working Now:**

### **✅ Fully Functional:**
1. **Load tasks from Google Sheets** - Timeline grouping, priority sorting
2. **Real-time checkbox updates** - Click checkbox → immediately updates Google Sheets
3. **Auto-refresh** - Checks for changes every 30 seconds
4. **Offline caching** - Works when offline, syncs when back online
5. **Progress tracking** - Visual progress bar with completion percentage

### **✅ Perfect for Surgery Prep:**
- **View all your surgery tasks** organized by timeline (Pre-op, Surgery Day, Post-op)
- **Check off completed items** with immediate Google Sheets sync
- **Share with family/friends** - they can see real-time updates

### **📝 Manual Operations (via Google Sheets):**
