INCISION: You may remove your hospital bandage 24 hours after you get home if not already done. Leave the
incision open to air unless instructed otherwise. The incision will be closed with dissolvable sutures and
covered with a Mepilex dressing. It's ok to remove the Mepilex dressing once you are home from the hospital
Please remove steri-strips after 2 weeks. If your incision has any drainage or openings, please use clean, dry,

sterile gauze to cover your incision and cover with a clean ace wrap bandage. Please also contact our office via

phone call or MyScripps Portal Message for us to further assess your incision. On occasion staples will be used
on patients with fragile skin or severe adhesive allergies.

BATHING: We recommend using a shower for bathing. A shower stall with a low entry step is recommended but
not required. You may use a high stool in the shower if there is space to sit on. Keep incision covered in the
shower for 7 days after surgery. We recommend covering the incision with a water-proof bandage, Saran
wrap or Glad press-n-seal. After 7 days you may shower like normal and get the incision wet. Do not soak
or submerge your incision under water (bathtub, jacuzzi, swimming) until you have seen Dr. Wilde for follow
up.

ICING: Ice your hip at least 5-10 times/day for 20 minutes at a time, especially following activity such as
physical therapy. Wrap ice pack in a thin towel or pillowcase so ice pack is not directly on your skin.
You may use anything cold: ice, frozen veggie bags, gel packs etc.

ACTIVITY
Rest Periods: Gradually increase your activity weekly. Short, frequent walks are recommended. Focus on range

of motion. Limit sitting to 30-60 minute intervals over the next 4 - 6 weeks. Sit with your legs elevated in a well-
supported chair.

Weight-bearing: You may put as much weight as is comfortable on your operative leg with activity. Use
your front-wheeled walker until you feel safe and steady on your feet. You may transition to a cane after
discontinuing the walker if you find it helpful

Physical Therapy: You will receive physical therapy following surgery: Home health PT, Luna PT or
outpatient PT based on what your insurance covers. If you are set up with Luna, they will call you prior to
surgery to set up your sessions, if you have not heard from Luna please call ph: 619-966-3822. Home health PT
is arranged by the hospital case managers prior to discharge. If your insurance doesnâ€™t cover home health PUK
you will be set up with outpatient PT. Home health PT will be about 2-3 days per week for about 2-4 weeks. After
graduating from home health, please let us know where you would like to go for outpatient_physical
therapy. You will continue outpatient PT for another 3-4 weeks.

Impact Loading: Low-impact activities such as walking can begin once your home. A stationary bike at low
resistance is usually ok at 3-4 weeks after surgery if you can safely get on/off the bike. Swimming is usually ok
around 4-5 weeks after surgery once the incision is completely healed. Golfing, hiking, and dancing can usually
resume around 8-12 weeks post-op. All other activities involving quick starts and stops, orimpact loading, such as
tennis, should be avoided to lower your risk of early loosening of the implant.

Driving: The timeframe to return to driving is different for everyone. You may drive when you are no longer
taking narcotics and no longer using the walker. While you are traveling as a passenger for the first 4-5 weeks
following surgery, it is advised that you get out of the car at least hourly and take a short walk.
