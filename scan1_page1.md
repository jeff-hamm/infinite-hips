If not-provided at your preop appointment, please purchase a 4-ounce bottle of 4% chlorhexidine
gluconate (CHG, brand name HibiclensÂ®) soap from your local pharmacy; a prescription is not

required.
Do not shave the area of the body where your surgery will be performed.

With each shower or bath, wash your hair and body as usual and rinse thoroughly to remove

shampoo and soap residue.

Turn off the water and apply a small amount of HibiclensÂ® (a quarter-size amount or 1
tablespoon) to your freshly laundered washcloth. Re-wash your entire body from the neck down
with HibiclensÂ®, avoiding your genitals, face, and head. Do not scrub your skin too hard or use
regular soap after using the HibiclensÂ® solution.

Wash thoroughly for 5 minutes, paying special attention to your surgical area. Allow

solution to dry for at least one minute.
Turn the water back on and rinse well.
Pat yourself dry with a freshly laundered towel and put on clean sleepwear/clothes.

On the day of surgery, DO NOT apply lotion, powder, cream, deodorant, perfume, hair product, or

makeup after your final shower with HibiclensÂ® soap

If you experience skin irritation from HibiclensÂ®, stop using the soap. If you are allergic to
CHG or develop skin irritation, please use any anti-bacterial soap.
