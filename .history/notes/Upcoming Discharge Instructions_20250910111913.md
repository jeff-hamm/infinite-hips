Dear Jeffrey C. Hamm,  
   
Below are the discharge instructions relating to the post-operative care for your upcoming procedure with Wilde, Jeffrey Michael, MD on 9/12/2025.  
   
You are recovering from a total hip replacement. Your damaged hip joint was replaced with an artificial joint, called a prosthesis.  The hip is a ball-and-socket joint. A cut was made, giving the surgeon access to your hip joint. The damaged ball was removed, and the socket was prepared to hold the prosthesis. After the new joint is in place, the incision is closed with staples or stitches.  An artificial ball replaces the head of the thighbone, and an artificial cup replaces the worn socket. A stem is inserted into the thigh bone to keep the ball in place. These parts connect to create your new artificial hip. A plastic liner is placed between the metal ball and cup to create a smooth surface for comfortable movement once you have healed.  This surgery almost always lessens joint pain and improves your quality of life.  Below are guidelines that your doctor requests that you follow, after you are discharged from the hospital.  
   
**MEDICATIONS AND PAIN MANAGEMENT AFTER SURGERY**  
   
If you have questions at any time, please contact your doctor’s office. Some pain is acceptable. The first thing to know is that having some pain is normal and should be expected after most surgical procedures. In fact, doctors now think that accepting some pain is a good thing, for a few reasons: 1\) Adapting to mild or moderate pain means you can use less medication, and using less medication (especially opioids, also known as narcotics), helps you avoid harmful side effects that can slow down your recovery, such as constipation or feeling woozy; 2\) Pain tells your body how much activity you can do as you recover; and 3\) Taking fewer opioids lowers your risk of becoming dependent on them.   
** **   
**Multiple ways to manage pain (also known as multi-modal pain management)**   
The best way to manage pain is through multi-modal pain management, which means using many different methods to minimize your pain. Using a combination of non-opioid (non-narcotic) medications and drug-free pain relief techniques often works better than a single medication and will help you recover as quickly and safely as possible while also reducing your exposure to opioid medication. The goal of multi-modal pain management is to use the least amount of opioids possible and stop using them as quickly as possible to avoid the risks of side effects and addiction.   
   
**Drug-free techniques to reduce pain**   
• Moving your joint (shorter walks more often, physical therapy exercises)   
• Ice Therapy (use a cold pack wrapped in a thin cloth and use up to 20 minutes every 3-4 hours, and remember to never put ice directly on your skin)   
• Elevation (to reduce swelling and pain elevate your operated area above the level of your heart if you can, this helps blood and fluid drain from the area)   
• Relaxation Techniques 

* Visualization or guided imagery   
* Progressive body relaxation   
* Deep breathing (include the incentive spirometer to keep your lungs healthy)   
* Distraction (reading, watching a movie, talking to friends, playing computer games) 

   
*If you are enrolled in Force Therapeutics, watch the “Relaxation Techniques and Pain Management” & “How to Manage Pain and Swelling” videos under Care Instructions on your Force Videos page*   
   
**Non-opioid medications your doctor may prescribe:**   
• Acetaminophen (Tylenol, APAP): the most gentle and safe pain medication you can take.   
• Anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs): ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), celecoxib (Celebrex and others. These medications can be taken along with Tylenol, but you may not be able to take NSAIDs if you have stomach ulcers or kidney disease.   
• Gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica): used for nerve pain or neuropathic pain.   
• Lidocaine patch: applied to your skin. It can be prescribed or obtained over the counter.   
**Opioids (narcotics) your doctor may prescribe**   
Opioids are very strong pain medications. They can have serious and unpleasant side effects, including addiction. Opioids include:   
• Morphine   
• Dilaudid   
• Oxycontin IR (Immediate Release)   
• Oxycodone (Percocet)   
• Hydrocodone (Norco)   
• Tramadol   
   
** Side effects of opioids**   
• Constipation   
• Feeling woozy or confused   
• Hallucinations   
• Nausea or vomiting   
• Increased risk of falls and accidents   
• Breathing problems   
• Addiction   
   
Five to 10 percent of people who take opioids for more than a few days will become dependent on them. The risk of addiction can increase after as little as three days of use, and people who become dependent often go through withdrawal when they stop taking an opioid medication. Withdrawal symptoms can be very unpleasant, and include:   
• Body aches   
• Nausea or vomiting   
• Diarrhea   
• Insomnia   
• Restlessness   
   
Tell your doctor right away if you think you are having trouble stopping opioid use or if you experience withdrawal symptoms.   
   
If you are worried about becoming addicted or have a history of substance abuse, talk with your healthcare provider before surgery.  An open discussion can protect you and ensure effective pain management strategies.   
   
**If you are prescribed an opioid**   
**• Remember that the goal is to get you back to your normal level of functioning, not to take away all your pain.**   
**• Do not drink alcohol while taking opioids (also known as narcotics).**   
• Make the most of all your other pain management options (ice, activity, other medications) before you take an opioid.   
• Ask your doctor how long you are expected to need an opioid. Have a goal for when you want to stop using it.   
• Your doctor may give you an option of one or two tablets per dose. Start with the lower dose and see if that works before taking the higher dose.   
• We advise most patients to stop opioids within three days. However, if your pain is severe and expected to continue for some time, you may be given a longer course of opioids.   
• Try to take the opioids less frequently each day. It is better to taper off gradually than to stop suddenly.   
• Ask your doctor if you would like a tapering schedule. This is a good idea if your doctor expects you to need opioids longer than three days.   
• Tell your medical team if you have side effects, like nausea or constipation—they can help you.   
   
**Proper disposal of opioid medication**   
Many patients do not use all the opioids that are prescribed to them. Leftover medications sitting in a medicine cabinet can end up being misused by someone else, such as a child, a guest or someone working in your home. Please store your medications in a safe place where no one else has access to them. Federal (FDA) guidelines recommend flushing any leftover opioids down the toilet, but San Diego County prefers that you throw them away mixed with compost, coffee grounds or kitty litter, or take them to an approved disposal site.   
   
**Using Blood Thinners (Anticoagulants)**  
Blood thinners are medicines that help prevent blood clots from forming.  They are also called anticoagulants.  The medicines include:

* Aspirin   
* Heparin   
* Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)   
* Apixaban (Eliquis)   
* Warfarin (Coumadin) 

**Before you start taking a blood thinner**   
Tell your healthcare provider if you have any of these: 

* Stomach Ulcer, now or in the past   
* Vomiting of blood   
* Blood in your stool (black or red color)   
* Aneurysm   
* Pericarditis   
* Pericardial effusion   
* Blood disorder   
* Stroke or mini-stroke (called a TIA)   
* Kidney or liver disease   
* Uncontrolled high blood pressure   
* Diabetes   
* Vasculitis 

**Medicines that interact with blood thinners** 

* Antibiotic medicine   
* Heart medicine   
* Cimetidine   
* Anti-inflammatory medicine such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, or arthritis medicine   
* Medicine for depression, cancer, HIV (protease inhibitors), diabetes, seizures, gout, high cholesterol, or thyroid   
* Multi-vitamins that have Vitamin K   
* Herbs such as ginkgo, Co-Q10, garlic, or St. John’s Wort 

This list may not include all medicines and supplements.  Please talk with your healthcare provider and pharmacist.   
**Taking a blood thinner safely**   
When you are taking a blood thinner, you will need to take care to stay safe.  Too much blood thinner puts you at risk for bleeding.  Too little puts you at risk for a blood clot.  Follow these guidelines.  Also, follow any others that your healthcare provider gives you. 

* Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines, including over the counter, supplements, and/or herbal remedies.  Do not take any medicines that your healthcare provider doesn’t know about.   
* Tell all your healthcare providers that you take a blood thinner.  This includes your dentist, chiropractor, nurse, and other doctors. 

**Blood thinners make bleeding harder to stop.  To protect yourself:** 

* Don’t do any activities that may cause injury.   
* Use a soft-bristle toothbrush and waxed dental floss.   
* Shave with an electric razor, not a blade   
* Don’t go barefoot.   
* Don’t' trim corns or calluses yourself. 

**Important Safety Information** 

* Take it as prescribed   
* Take it at the same time each day   
* Tell your healthcare provider about changes in your meds   
* Be careful not to injure yourself 

**Watch what you eat** 

* Talk with your healthcare provider and pharmacist about foods or ingredients that can affect blood thinner levels.  These include, and may not be limited to, grapefruit juice, cranberries and cranberry juice, fish oil, garlic, ginger, licorice, turmeric, and herbal teas and supplements.  

**When to call your healthcare provider**   
Call right away if you have any of the these: 

* Bleeding that doesn’t stop in 10 minutes   
* Coughing up or vomiting blood   
* Bloody diarrhea   
* Bleeding Hemorrhoids   
* Dark-colored urine   
* Black stools   
* Red or black-and-blue marks on the skin that get larger   
* Dizziness   
* Chest pain   
* Trouble breathing   
* Rash   
* Itching   
* Swelling   
* Trouble swallowing 

   
   
**Tips for Taking Medicines**  
It’s easy to forget to take your medicine, especially when you take a lot of pills.  But, to get best results from medicines, always take them as directed.  The tips below can help you keep track.   
**Stay on schedule** 

* Take your medicine at set times being mindful if they need to be taken at specific times, for example, some meds need to be taken at specific times or with food.   
* Find ways to remind yourself to take your meds.  Use a pillbox or 7-day organizer.  Set an alarm on your watch or cell phone.   
* Refill prescriptions when you still have plenty of pills left.  Sometimes refills can be delayed, for example mail-order pharmacies, etc.   
* When you travel be sure to keep your meds in your carry-on bag in case you and your checked luggage become separated.  Also, bring copies of your prescriptions when you travel. 

**Safety Tips** 

* Read warning labels and usage instructions.  Also, keep these safety tips in mind.   
* Get help organizing your pills if you need it.  Taking more than one med can be confusing.   
* Use the same drug store for all your prescriptions whenever possible   
* Ask the pharmacist for a “fact sheet” or other patient information when starting a new med.   
* Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you have allergies to any meds.   
* Don’t split your pills to save money.  Talk to your doctor if you’re having trouble paying for your medication.   
* Never share meds with anyone.   
* Ask your pharmacy how to dispose of old or expired meds.   
* Give a copy of your med list to a family member or close friend in case of emergency.   
* Store meds in a cool, dry, dark place – not in a steamy bathroom.   
* Keep your Opioids (also known as narcotics),   
* In a locked container   
* In their original package   
* Out of reach of children   
* Do not share with others   
* Safely dispose of unused pills   
     
   

**DIET AFTER SURGERY**  
   
You may resume your normal diet.  For optimal healing, it is important to maintain a healthy diet.  Constipation can be a problem after surgery due to anesthesia, pain meds, and decreased activity.  The following are recommendations to prevent and relieve constipation:  

* High Fiber Diet (fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, bran, etc.)    
* Drink plenty of fluids, preferably water    
* Stool softeners (Peri-colace, Sennokot-S)   
  * softens stool, lubricates the intestine   
* Laxatives (Miralax, Milk of Magnesia, Dulcolax, Magnesium Citrate)   
  * Stimulates the intestine, if take too much can cause diarrhea   
* Suppository   
  * Physically/chemically stimulates the bowel   
  * Helpful to take within 30 minutes of eating a meal   
* Enema   
  * Physically stimulates a bowel movement   
  * Use as last resort due to possible addiction 

   
**If taking narcotics, you may find this regimen helpful:** 

1. First Day Home – begin Peri-colace or Sennokot-S taking 1 tablet by mouth TWICE a day with plenty of water.   
2. Second Day Home – if you have not had a bowel movement, continue taking \#1 and add Miralax. Take 1 capful with 6-8 ounces of water in the evening.   
3. Third day home – if you have NOT had a bowel movement, continue taking \#1 and \#2, and add a bisacodyl (Dulcolax) suppository 

   
Decrease use of stool softeners and laxatives when your bowel function returns to normal and/or when you decrease use of opioids (also known as narcotics).  Consult your Primary Care Physician or Orthopaedic Surgeon if you have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or have not had a bowel movement by the 5th day after surgery.   
    
*If you are enrolled in Force Therapeutics, watch the “Nutrition Tips”, & “Constipation Recommendations” video under Care Instructions on your Force Video page.*   
   
   
**ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AFTER TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT**  
Your surgeon will provide you specific instructions regarding your hip precautions, please be sure to follow those specific instructions.  
   
You must re-learn how to perform daily tasks while complying with your hip precautions. These precautions last 4-6 weeks and therefore it is important you learn how to perform these tasks independently with the use of adaptive equipment, so that you are not relying on someone else for this duration.   
   
**Remember your hip precautions**:  
Low Risk Precautions: 

* Do not cross your legs or ankles and do not allow your operated leg to cross the middle of your body. 

High Risk Precautions:

* Do not bend at your hip or waist more than 90 degrees (always sit with your knees lower than or level with your new hip).   
* Do not cross your legs or ankles and do not allow your operated leg to cross the middle of your body.   
* Do not turn or rotate your operated leg inwards. 

   
**Dressing**   
**Always sit down on a stable surface when getting dressed. A “hip kit” is helpful when dressing yourself independently while complying with hip precautions to prevent you from bending your hip too much.** A sock aid allows you to put on socks, while a dressing stick allows you to take clothing off. A reacher is used for ease of putting on pants, shorts and underwear, and long handled shoe-horn is used for ease of putting shoes on. Slip on sneakers or elastic shoelaces may make getting shoes on and off easier. Do not wear flip flops as this can alter your gait pattern and may lead to higher risk of falls.   
   
 *If you are enrolled in Force Therapeutics, watch the “Dressing” video under Care Instructions on your Force Video page.*   
   
**Toileting**   
Place a commode over your toilet or use a raised toilet seat to ensure compliance with hip precautions when sitting.    
   
**Bathing**   
Because it can be challenging to step in and out of a bathtub, we recommend using a shower stall, or placing a **transfer tub bench** over your bathtub if a stall is not available. Sit down on a **shower chair**, **tub bench**, or **commode** while bathing to prevent falls. To avoid bending your hip too much, use a **long-handled sponge** and a **handheld shower head**. Ask for clearance from your MD for when it is safe to shower. See *Wound Care* below for instructions.  Do not soak the incision (i.e., bathtub, pool, Jacuzzi) until after you have been cleared by your surgeon.    
   
*If you are enrolled in Force Therapeutics, watch the “Bathing” video under Care Instructions on your Force Video page.*   
   
**Driving**   
You should not drive until cleared by your surgeon and are no longer taking narcotics. While you are traveling as a passenger for the first 3-4 weeks, it is advised to get out of the car and take a short walk hourly to prevent blood clots.   
   
*If you are enrolled in Force Therapeutics, watch the “Driving” video under Care Instructions on your Force video page*   
   
   
**Getting in and out of the car**  
To keep your hip safe, follow your hip precautions. Prior to getting into your car, have someone move the seat back as far as it will go. Recline the back of the seat if possible. Place a pillow on the seat to keep your hips above your knees, especially if the seat is low. Stand with your back to the car, stepping back until you feel the car touch the back of your legs, then step your operative leg slightly forward. Next, reach one hand back for the seat or dashboard, while keeping the other on the walker handle while you slowly lower yourself down onto the seat. Watch your head. Scoot back into the center of the seat, before lifting your legs into the car one by one. As you do so, be sure not to twist.   
   
**Returning to Work**   
The decision to return to work will be based on the type of work you do, your physical stamina, and whether you have other medical conditions. This time period can be anywhere from 1-3 months following your surgery. We recommend that you avoid making any major changes in your work or retirement plans until your recovery is complete.   
   
 *If you are enrolled in Force Therapeutics, watch the “Returning to Work “ video under Care Instructions on your Force video page*.  
   
**Returning to Sex**   
After the incision heals and you regain some movement, ask your surgeon or the office nurse if it is safe to start having sex and what positions are safe. Try to avoid putting too much pressure on your new joint. Take precaution when getting in and out of positions, ensuring to keep your new joint within a safe range of motion.   
   
 *If you are enrolled in Force Therapeutics, watch the “Returning to Sex “ video under Care Instruction on your personal Force video page*.  
   
**Returning to Activity**   
Activities as simple as getting out of bed, walking, and doing daily tasks safely with your new joint can feel overwhelming. To keep your new joint safe and prevent falls, always think before you move. A good way to stay active is by making it a part of your daily routine. When your care partner or coach brings you a glass of water or something to eat, use this as a reminder to get up and do a short walk around your home. The best way to get back into your normal daily routine is to stay active. Short, but frequent bouts of walking will help you to recover more quickly. Talk with your surgeon about the activities that you want to resume. Your surgeon will tell you when and how you can safely return to activities such as sex, swimming, gardening, and driving.   
   
**Housekeeping**    
Is your home as safe as it should be? Or, are there potential hazards, like rugs and cords, ready to trip you up? Make sure your home is safe and free of hazards before you return. Ask your care partner or coach to help prepare your living space if you have not already done so. This helps make it safer and more comfortable while you heal.   
   
*If you are enrolled in Force Therapeutics, please refer to the PDF “Home Prep Checklist” on your personal Force account*.  
   
**When to call your healthcare provider**   
Once at home, call your healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms: 

1. An increase in pain unrelieved by pain medication  
2. Pain or swelling in the calf or leg   
3. Unusual redness, heat, or drainage at the incision site   
4. Fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, or as directed by your healthcare provider   
5. Shaking chills   
6. Trouble breathing or chest pain (call 911\) 

   
**DRESSING/WOUND CARE (IF APPLICABLE)**  
**Wound care: Please follow all wound care instructions provided by your surgeon.**   
Managing your incision: Following these guidelines will be helpful in preventing a surgical site infection 

* Follow dressing care as directed by the surgeon   
* Protect your incision from injury, including curious pets, until the incision has healed   
* Avoid tight clothing that may rub and irritate the incision or interfere with wound healing   
* Contact your surgeon with any symptoms of infection including redness, excessive drainage, increased or unusual pain at the surgical site, fever greater than 101, or chills 

   
**Recognizing and Treating Wound Infection**   
Wounds can become infected with harmful germs (bacteria). This prevents healing. It also increases your risk of scars.    
   
**What are the symptoms of infection?**   
Call your healthcare provider at the first sign of infection, such as: 

* Redness, warmth around the wound   
* Edges look like they are opening   
* Yellow, yellow-green, or foul-smelling drainage from the wound  
* More pain, swelling, or redness in or near the wound   
* A change in the color or size of the wound   
* Red streaks in the skin around the wound   
* Fever 

**Preventing wound infection**   
Follow these steps to help keep wounds from getting infected: 

* Follow dressing care per your surgeon’s instructions   
* Don't soak your wound in water until your provider says it’s OK. This means no hot tubs, bathtubs, ocean, or swimming pools. 

   
**LINES & DRAIN INSTRUCTIONS (IF APPLICABLE)**  
**Managing Drains**  
This information is a supplement to any other education provided by your surgeon. If your surgeon gives you specific instructions that differ from the following information, it is important to follow directions given by your surgeon. If you will be discharged without a drain, please disregard the following information.  If you are going home with a device called a **Prevena wound vac** here are a few important instructions to follow: 

* The dressing on your incision is water resistant and may get wet in the shower.   
* The device should remain in place until 7 days after surgery, then you may remove it and discard the device. It is not reusable. You may leave your incision open to air or covered if you find that more comfortable.   
* Any other information regarding other types of drains that you will have to manage at home after discharge will be provided by the surgeon. 

   
**GENERAL GUIDELINES**   
   
**Handwashing: Tips for Patients, Family, and Friends**:  Germs are everywhere around us. Keeping your hands clean is the best way to prevent getting or spreading germs that can cause your incision to get infected. Wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand cleaner. If you don’t have access to soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand gel containing at least 60% alcohol. These products kill most germs and are easy to use. But if your hands are visibly dirty, use soap and water (not alcohol-based hand gel).  
   
The longer you wash your hands, the more germs you’ll remove. Most people wash their hands for 6 to 7 seconds. But at least 15 seconds are needed to remove germs. Singing Happy Birthday or the ABC Song are examples of how long 15 seconds would be. To protect yourself and others from infection, washing for 30 seconds is best.   
   
To help prevent infection, wash your hands often, especially: 

* After using the bathroom   
* Before and after eating   
* After coughing or sneezing   
* After using a tissue   
* After touching or changing a dressing or bandage   
* After touching any object or surface that may be contaminated   
* After touching an animal during a pet therapy session (hospital)   
* After touching an animal, cleaning up after a pet, or preparing food for pets (home) 

If you have family and/or friends visiting and/or assisting you with your care, make sure to have them wash their hands or use an alcohol-based hand cleaner when:

* Before entering and after leaving the patient’s room   
* As soon as you remove gloves or other protective clothing   
* After changing a dressing or bandage   
* After any contact with blood or other body fluids   
* After touching or changing the patient’s bed linen or towels   
* After touching an animal during a pet therapy session (hospital)   
* After touching an animal, cleaning up after a pet, or preparing food for pets (home) 

If your hands are visibly dirty, use soap and water (not alcohol-based hand gel). Tips for good handwashing   
to follow: 

* Use either cold or warm water and plenty of soap. Work up a good lather.   
* Clean the whole hand, including under your nails, between your fingers, and up the wrists.   
* Wash for at least 15 to 30 seconds. Don’t just wipe. Scrub well. Sing the Happy Birthday song to reach the 30- second goal   
* Rinse. Let the water run down your fingers, not up your wrists.   
* Dry your hands well. Use a paper towel to turn off the faucet and open the door. 

Alcohol-based hand cleaners may kill more germs than soap and water. Use them when your hands aren’t visibly dirty. For best results, follow these steps: 

* Choose a gel or spray that contains at least 60% alcohol. Products with less alcohol may not kill germs.   
* Spread about a tablespoon of cleaner in the palm of one hand.   
* Rub your hands together briskly, cleaning the backs of your hands, the palms, between your fingers, and up the wrists.   
* Rub until the cleaner is gone, and your hands are completely dry. 

   
**Pets**   
When you return home, it is best it is best to be sitting when you are re-introduced to your pet to limit the risk of falls   
Do not let your pet jump on you or lick you. This is for safety and to prevent infection.    
   
**Fall Prevention** 

* Free up your hands so that you can use them to keep balance. Use a fanny pack, apron, or pockets to carry things.   
* Follow your healthcare provider's orders about how much weight to place on the affected leg.   
* Do all exercises as instructed.   
* Arrange your household to keep the items you need within reach.   
* Remove electrical cords, throw rugs, and anything else that may cause you to fall.   
* Use nonslip bathmats, grab bars, an elevated toilet seat, and a shower chair in your bathroom. 

   
**Preventing Deep Vein Thrombosis After Surgery**   
In the days and weeks after surgery, you have a higher chance of developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This is a condition in which a blood clot or thrombus develops in a deep vein. They are most common in the leg. But, a DVT may develop in an arm, or another deep vein in the body. A piece of the clot, called an embolus, can separate from the vein and travel to the lungs. A blood clot in the lungs is called a pulmonary embolus (PE). This can cut off the flow of blood to the lungs. It's a medical emergency and may cause death.   
Healthcare providers use the term venous thromboembolism (VTE) to describe both DVT and PE. They use the term VTE because the two conditions are very closely related. And, because their prevention and treatment are closely related.

|   Prevention at home \- Ankle exercises can help keep blood flowing in the veins (see image). |
| :---- |

Deep vein thrombosis can happen even after you go home. Follow all instructions from your healthcare provider. The following are some general guidelines about DVT prevention:  

* Blood-thinner medicine.  If a blood thinner was prescribed, make sure you follow all directions about taking it. Be sure you know what foods and medicines may interact. Also ask your healthcare provider what to do if you forget to take a dose.   
* Returning to activity.  Follow all instructions about returning to activities. Be as active as you can. This improves blood flow and helps prevent a clot from forming. When in bed or in a chair, continue with the ankle exercises you did in the hospital.

   
**Flying**   
It is important to get clearance from your surgeon prior to flying after your joint replacement   
   
**Dental**   
Tell your dentist that you have an artificial joint. Take antibiotics as prescribed before any dental work. All patients with an artificial joint MUST have antibiotic prophylaxis prior to any dental work  
   
   
**Diabetes**   
If you are diabetic, it is important to keep your blood sugars well managed throughout your recovery from joint replacement. Poorly controlled diabetes prevents the body from healing optimally, slows down the healing process, and increases the risk of getting an infection. It is important to do what you can to keep your blood sugar within your target range as this will allow optimal wound healing.  If you have trouble with blood sugar control, please contact your primary healthcare provider.   
   
   
 **WHEN TO CALL YOUR PHYSICIAN**  
Follow-up is very important after surgery.  Your cooperation in returning to see your doctor at the listed times is appreciated.  Please **call** the doctor(s) listed ***within the next 24 hours*** to schedule your follow up appointment(s).  Your surgeon will need to examine you, and this will allow them to determine if your joint replacement is progressing and observe for any potential problems.  The surgeon will be able to update you on your activity allowances at each office visit.  Please make sure to also follow up with your Primary Care Provider after having surgery. It will be important for them to know that you have had this surgery in order for them to help guide your health care  
   
If a problem regarding your surgery occurs, please call your surgeon’s office to determine if an office appointment is necessary.  Please see your Primary Care Doctor in 1 month to update of medical history.  **If you have insurance that requires a referral, please remember to obtain one for each office visit after your surgery**.  
   
This instruction sheet has been written to give you useful information following your surgery.  This is not a substitute for or in place of your doctor’s instructions.  If you have been advised differently based on your individual needs, please follow your doctor’s recommendations.  If you have any questions, please call your doctor’s office.  
   
**CALL YOUR PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY SYMPTOMS BELOW**
