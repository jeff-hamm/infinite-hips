## 2 Years of Antibiotic Prophylaxis After Total Joint Replacement

For protection against the remote possibility of blood-borne bacteria, carried from the mouth during a dental procedure, creating an infection in a total joint replacement, a combined task force of American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Dental Association has made the following guideline recommendations:

### 1. Standard Prophylaxis Requirements

Following total joint replacement, all patients are advised to take an antibiotic regimen for **2 years** when undergoing dental procedures such as:

- Prophylactic cleaning of teeth or implants
- Intraligamentary local anesthetic injections
- Periodontal procedures
- Root canal procedures
- Dental extractions
- Dental implant procedures
- Implantation of avulsed teeth
- Initial placement of orthodontic bands

### 2. Lifetime Antibiotic Prophylaxis

**Lifetime antibiotic prophylaxis** for dental procedures is recommended for patients considered at higher risk:

- Solid organ transplant
- Rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatologic conditions affecting the immune system
- Diabetics
- Smokers
- Chronic renal disease
- BMI >40
- Patients taking disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, biologics, steroids, or chemotherapy

### 3. Standard Antibiotic Regimen

**If not allergic to penicillin:**
- **Amoxicillin**, **Cephalexin** (e.g. Keflex), or **Cephradine**
- **Dosage:** 2.0 grams orally
- **Timing:** 1 hour prior to the dental procedure

### 4. Penicillin Allergy Alternative

**For patients with a penicillin allergy:**
- **Doxycycline** (e.g. Vibramycin) 100 mg, OR
- **Azithromycin** (e.g. Zithromax) 500 mg
- **Timing:** 1 hour prior to the dental procedure

### 5. Important Restrictions

- **No dental visits for 3 months after surgery** unless it is an emergency
- If you have a dental emergency, call our office AND your dentist

### 6. Getting Prescriptions

Call your surgeon's office when you will be going to the dentist to receive an antibiotic prescription, or your dentist may also prescribe an antibiotic for you.
