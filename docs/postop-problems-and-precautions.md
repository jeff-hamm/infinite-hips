# Post-Operative Problems and Precautions

**From:** Dr. Jeffrey Wilde, MD  
**Scripps Clinic** - Clinical Assistant Professor of Orthopedic Surgery

## Recovery Guidelines

### Returning to Work
The decision to return to work will be based on:
- The type of work you do
- Your physical stamina
- Whether you have other medical conditions

**Timeline:** Anywhere from **1-3 months** following the procedure.

**Recommendation:** Avoid making any major changes in your work or retirement plans until your recovery is complete.

### Precautions
- **No hyperextension or external rotation** of the surgical hip for **three months post-op**

### Traveling/Flying
Traveling for a long period time can increase your risk for developing blood clots.

**Restrictions:**
- **AVOID domestic flights for 6 weeks**
- **AVOID international flights for 3 months** after joint replacement surgery
- **Long drives are OK** if you take frequent breaks (one per hour) to stretch and take steps

**Always check with Dr. Wilde regarding travel and when it is safe to do so.**

## Common Problems

### Leg & Ankle Swelling
- You may have some swelling in your operated leg that should gradually decrease
- **Treatment:** Lie down, elevate your legs above the level of your heart, and rest

### Pain
- Pain may be a result of over-activity
- **Treatment:** When you are in pain, sit or lie down, elevate your legs, and rest
- If the pain does not subside, take the pain medication prescribed for you
- **Important:** Pain is a protective mechanism that helps to prevent over-usage and should not be ignored

### Difficulty Sleeping
- Most patients report more pain at night than during the day, resulting in difficulty sleeping
- **Treatment:** You may try Tylenol PM or Melatonin at bedtime if this occurs

## When to Call Our Office

**Call our office at (858) 554-7993** or **go to your nearest urgent care** if you experience:

- Temperature of **101° or higher**
- **Drainage from your incision**
- **Increasing redness** around your incision
- **Increasing pain** around the incision, unrelieved by pain medication
- **Excessive calf pain & swelling** that does not go away with elevation
