## Daily Washing Instructions

### Day of Surgery - Important

1. **Initial wash:** Wash your hair and body as usual and rinse thoroughly to remove shampoo and soap residue
2. **Turn off the water** and apply a small amount of HibiclensÂ® (a quarter-size amount or 1 tablespoon) to your freshly laundered washcloth
3. **Re-wash your entire body** from the neck down with HibiclensÂ®, avoiding your genitals, face, and head
4. **Wash thoroughly for 5 minutes,** paying special attention to your surgical area
5. **Do not scrub** your skin too hard or use regular soap after using the HibiclensÂ® solution
6. **Turn water off and allow solution to dry** for at least one minute
7. **Turn the water back on** and rinse well
8. **Pat yourself dry** with a freshly laundered towel and put on clean sleepwear/clothes

> **DO NOT apply** lotion, powder, cream, deodorant, perfume, hair product, or makeup after your final shower with HibiclensÂ® soap

### If You Experience Skin Irritation

If you experience skin irritation from HibiclensÂ®, stop using the soap. If you are allergic to CHG or develop skin irritation, please use any anti-bacterial soap instead.
