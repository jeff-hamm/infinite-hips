### 🏥 Post-Operative Pain Management
Opioids are often prescribed to help provide pain relief in the early postoperative period.

## ⚠️ Critical Safety Information

> Please note that we take great care with pain medication prescriptions (opioids) and want you to be aware that **the use of opioids can lead to addiction and overdose**, depending on amount used and duration of use.

**Risk is increased in persons who suffer from:**
- Mental illness
- Substance use disorders

## 🚨 Dangerous Drug Interactions

> Taking opioids in conjunction with the following substances **increases the risk of sedation and respiratory depression which can have consequences as significant as death:**

- **Benzodiazepines**
- **Sleep aids**
- **Muscle relaxants**
- **Alcohol**
- **Recreational drugs**
- **Other sedatives**

## 📅 Weaning Off Opioids

> We advise patients to **completely wean off of opioids once they are near the one month post-op mark** after their surgery, as it is not recommended to be on opioids for long periods of time.

### Important Guidelines
- Follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off opioids
- Never stop opioids suddenly without medical supervision
- Communicate with your healthcare team about pain levels
- Consider alternative pain management strategies as you heal
