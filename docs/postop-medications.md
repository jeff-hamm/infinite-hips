## 💩 Constipation Management
To avoid constipation, take a stool softener (Colace) twice a day while on pain medication. You may also need a light laxative such as Senokot. If you have not had a bowel movement by day 3 after surgery, please take over the counter MiraLAX.

## ☀️ Vitamin D
Essential for bone health. It is recommended you take a vitamin D supplement (2000 IU during the first 90 days after surgery) to help with bone healing.

**Note:** Purchase over the counter

## 🍽️ Diet
You may resume your normal diet. It is important to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. Include plenty of fluids, as pain medications and anesthesia cause constipation.
