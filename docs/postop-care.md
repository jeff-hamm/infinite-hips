**Source:** [üì∏ View Original Document Image](../scans_md/postop-care.jpg)

## Dr. Jeffrey Wilde, MD
Clinical Assistant Professor of Orthopedic Surgery  
Division Head, Section of Lower Extremity Reconstruction  
Scripps Clinic/Scripps Clinic Medical Group

## Post-Operative Care Instructions

### ü©π Incision Care
- **Remove hospital bandage 24 hours after you get home** if not already done
- **Leave the incision open to air** unless instructed otherwise
- The incision will be closed with dissolvable sutures and covered with a Mepilex dressing
- It's OK to remove the Mepilex dressing once you are home from the hospital
- **Remove steri-strips after 2 weeks**

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è If Incision Has Drainage or Openings
- Use clean, dry, sterile gauze to cover your incision
- Cover with a clean ace wrap bandage
- **Contact our office via phone call or MyScripps Portal Message** for further assessment

*On occasion staples will be used on patients with fragile skin or severe adhesive allergies.*

### üöø Bathing Instructions
**We recommend using a shower for bathing.** A shower stall with a low entry step is recommended but not required. You may use a high stool in the shower if there is space to sit on.

#### First 7 Days After Surgery:
- **Keep incision covered in the shower**
- Use a water-proof bandage, Saran wrap or Glad press-n-seal

#### After 7 Days:
- **You may shower like normal** and get the incision wet
- **Do not soak or submerge** your incision under water (bathtub, jacuzzi, swimming) until you have seen Dr. Wilde for follow up

### üßä Icing Protocol
- **Ice your hip at least 5-10 times/day for 20 minutes at a time**
- Especially following activity such as physical therapy
- **Wrap ice pack in a thin towel or pillowcase** so ice pack is not directly on your skin
- You may use anything cold: ice, frozen veggie bags, gel packs etc.

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Activity Guidelines

### Rest Periods
- **Gradually increase your activity weekly**
- Short, frequent walks are recommended
- Focus on range of motion
- **Limit sitting to 30-60 minute intervals** over the next 4-6 weeks
- Sit with your legs elevated in a well-supported chair

### Weight-bearing
- **You may put as much weight as is comfortable** on your operative leg with activity
- Use your front-wheeled walker until you feel safe and steady on your feet
- You may transition to a cane after discontinuing the walker if you find it helpful

### Physical Therapy
You will receive physical therapy following surgery: **Home health PT, Luna PT or outpatient PT** based on what your insurance covers.

- **Luna PT:** They will call you prior to surgery to set up sessions. If you haven't heard from Luna, call (619) 966-3822
- **Home health PT:** Arranged by hospital case managers prior to discharge
- **Home health schedule:** About 2-3 days per week for about 2-4 weeks
- **Outpatient PT:** Continue for another 3-4 weeks after graduating from home health

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Impact Loading & Activities
- **Low-impact activities** such as walking can begin once you're home
- **Stationary bike** at low resistance is usually OK at 3-4 weeks after surgery if you can safely get on/off
- **Swimming** is usually OK around 4-5 weeks after surgery once the incision is completely healed
- **Golfing, hiking, and dancing** can usually resume around 8-12 weeks post-op
- **Avoid high-impact activities** like tennis to lower your risk of early loosening of the implant

### üöó Driving
The timeframe to return to driving is different for everyone. You may drive when you are:
- No longer taking narcotics
- No longer using the walker

While traveling as a passenger for the first 4-5 weeks following surgery, get out of the car at least hourly and take a short walk.
