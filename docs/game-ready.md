## GAME READY?

> The Game Ready® GRPro® 2.1 system features innovative, patented **ACCEL® Technology** (Active Compression and Cold Exchange Loop), enabling the integrated delivery of continuous cold and intermittent pneumatic compression therapies.

The portable GRPro 2.1 has set a new standard in non-narcotic musculoskeletal injury pain relief and accelerated healing.

## The Advantages of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression and Cryotherapy Treatment

### 🔄 Active vs. Passive Treatment
Going beyond passive, static cold and compression applications, the GRPro 2.1 therapy system works actively and dynamically to accelerate and enhance recovery. Game Ready's anatomic, circumferential wraps envelope the surgery site and then conform to the contours of the body with pneumatic compression, assuring better surface contact and thus more effective cooling.

### ⚡ Enhanced Recovery Benefits
Game Ready provides faster, deeper, and longer-lasting therapy than most other products.

Intermittent pneumatic cryo-compression shortens recovery timelines and improves patient's pain and discomfort after surgery without the harmful effects of medications. Game Ready's Active Compression and Cold Exchange Loop provides the therapeutic power to:
- Enhance lymphatic function
- Encourage blood flow
- Stimulate tissue healing

### 🎛️ Advanced Features
The GRPro 2.1 features pre-set programs and easily customize compression levels, temperature, and time settings with the touch of a button or the turn of a dial. These pre-set programs allow cryotherapy treatment even during sleep with programmed 30 minute treatment cycles.

## Important Notes

> **Important:** Typically, surgical procedures use the Game Ready for 2-3 weeks. We have seen it make a big difference in patient's recoveries. While the Game Ready System will certainly assist in your recovery, please remember that **it is your choice** whether or not to use the system.

If you choose to order Game Ready for use after your surgery, please contact the local Game Ready rep at least one week prior to your surgery date to schedule delivery and training a few days before your surgery.
