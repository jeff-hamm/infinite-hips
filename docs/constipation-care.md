**Source:** [üì∏ View Original Document Image](../scans_md/constipation-care.jpg)

## Understanding Constipation
Constipation is the infrequent or difficult passage of hard stool, which often causes pain and discomfort.

## ü•ó Diet Recommendations
You should increase the amount of high fiber foods:

- **Fresh raw fruits** with skins and seeds
- **Fresh raw vegetables**
- **Bran**
- **Fruit juices** (like prune juice)
- **Warm or hot fluids in the morning** are especially helpful
- **Increase fluid intake overall** to help prevent dehydration

## Medication Options

### üíä Stool Softeners (Colace)
- Help to lubricate the intestine so that stool can pass through more easily
- Do not chemically stimulate the bowel
- Used primarily to **prevent constipation**

### üíä Laxatives
Chemically stimulate the bowel causing it to move faster. These include:
- Miralax
- Milk of Magnesium
- Dulcolax tablets
- Magnesium Citrate

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Be careful not to take too much as they can cause diarrhea.

### üîÑ Suppositories
- Chemically or physically stimulate the bowel
- **Work best within ¬Ω hour after a meal**

### üíß Enemas
- Physically stimulate defecation by flushing out the area
- **Fleets enemas** usually work well and are easy to give
- **Only given when everything else has failed**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** If overused can cause "addiction" in which you will be unable to have a bowel movement without an enema.

## If Taking a Narcotic - Follow This Regimen

### üìã Step-by-Step Protocol

#### Step 1:
**Begin taking Colace or Senakot.** Take one tablet by mouth twice a day with plenty of water.

#### Step 2:
**If you have not had a bowel movement by the second day,** continue with #1 and take one capful of Miralax every morning.

#### Step 3:
**If you have not had a bowel movement by the third day,** continue with #1 and #2, and take a Dulcolax suppository, one rectally, every 12 hours.

#### Step 4:
**If you still have not had a bowel movement after the above treatment,** continue with #1, #2 and #3, and take one full bottle of Magnesium Citrate, undiluted.

#### Step 5:
**If all of these measures have failed to induce a bowel movement, call your surgeon's office.**

## üîÑ If You Develop Loose Stools
If you develop loose, frequent, or watery bowel movements, **reverse these steps** by reducing or stopping medications in reverse order.

## üìû Contact Your Surgeon's Office If:
- All constipation management steps have failed
- You experience severe abdominal pain
- You develop concerning symptoms
- You have questions about the protocol
