        <h2>Game Ready® GRPro® 2.1 System</h2>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The Game Ready® GRPro® 2.1 system features innovative, patented <strong>ACCEL® Technology</strong> (Active Compression and Cold Exchange Loop), enabling the integrated delivery of continuous cold and intermittent pneumatic compression therapies.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The portable GRPro 2.1 has set a new standard in non-narcotic musculoskeletal injury pain relief and accelerated healing.</p>

        <h2>The Advantages of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression and Cryotherapy Treatment</h2>

        <div class="benefits">
            <h3>🔄 Active vs. Passive Treatment</h3>
            <p>Going beyond passive, static cold and compression applications, the GRPro 2.1 therapy system works actively and dynamically to accelerate and enhance recovery. Game Ready's anatomic, circumferential wraps envelope the surgery site and then conform to the contours of the body with pneumatic compression, assuring better surface contact and thus more effective cooling.</p>
