## Therapy Recommendations

### 🏥 Day of Surgery
On the day of your surgery, you will work with a physical therapist. The physical therapist's expectation is to assess what you may be able to perform bed exercises, move from lying to sitting at bedside, or sitting to standing.

The physical therapist will assist you in getting out of bed. There are factors that may limit the amount of out of bed activity you can participate in, however it is expected that you:
- Sit at bedside
- Attempt standing with the walker

### 🏠 Before Going Home
Generally for joint replacement, you must be able to perform the following **without hands-on assistance:**

#### Required Skills for Discharge:
1. **Get in and out of bed** with the bed flat and no grab bars
2. **Stand up from the bed**
3. **Walk at least 100 ft with a walker**
4. **Complete stair training for home,** if necessary

### 🏃‍♀️ Physical Therapy Arrangements
You will receive physical therapy following surgery based on what your insurance covers:

#### 🏠 Home Health PT
- **Arranged by:** Hospital case managers prior to discharge
- **Schedule:** About 2-3 days per week for about 2-4 weeks
- **Coverage:** If your insurance doesn't cover home health PT, you will be set up with outpatient PT

#### 📱 Luna PT
- **Contact:** They will call you prior to surgery to set up your sessions
- **If you haven't heard from Luna:** Call (619) 966-3822
- **Convenience:** Comes to your home

#### 🏢 Outpatient PT
- **When:** After graduating from home health PT
- **Duration:** Continue for another 3-4 weeks
- **Location Choice:** Let us know where you would like to go for outpatient physical therapy

### 🏠 Home Health Physical Therapy Details
Typically, a Home Health Physical Therapist will come to your home 24-48 hours after discharge. This is NOT a caregiving service. They will:
- Assess home safety
- Improve your walking pattern
- Provide stair training if needed
- Progress exercises and range of motion of the joint
- Come to your home for about 1 hour, 2 times a week for about 2-4 weeks depending on progress

### 📋 Pre-Surgery Recommendations
- If you already have a walker, practice using the walker in your home
- Practice going up and down stairs at home with or without railing

### 🛠️ Adaptive Equipment
Equipment that might be recommended by your therapist for your convenience and safety, but may not be covered by insurance:
- Raised toilet seat
- Grab bars
- Commode
- Shower chair/tub-bench
- Sock aid
- Leg lifter
- Reachers/grabbers

Consider the height of your bed and possible need for elevation.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Caregiver Recommendations
It is recommended that you have a physically capable family member, friend, and/or hired caregiver present 24/7 for the first 2-5 days and nights.
