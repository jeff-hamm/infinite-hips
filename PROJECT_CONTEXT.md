# Project Context & Development History

## Overview

This workspace contains "Infinite Hips" - a comprehensive hip replacement surgery documentation and support coordination website. The project was developed to help organize pre/post-operative care, coordinate family/friend support, and provide easy access to all medical documentation.

## Development Timeline & Decisions

### Initial Request (Session Start)

- **User Goal**: Create a shareable spreadsheet from scanned medical documents for upcoming hip replacement surgery
- **Surgery Details**: September 12, 2025, Dr. Jeffrey Wilde at Scripps Mission Valley
- **Source Material**: 7 scanned medical documents (JPG format) with corresponding markdown files

### Evolution of Requirements

1. **Phase 1**: CSV spreadsheet creation → Surgery support schedule with 79+ tasks
2. **Phase 2**: GitHub Pages website → Full documentation site with table of contents
3. **Phase 3**: Design refinement → Dark theme matching user's existing sites
4. **Phase 4**: Color scheme updates → Lighter pink accents, gray headers
5. **Phase 5**: Interactive features → CSV to HTML conversion with checkboxes, filters, auto-save
6. **Phase 6**: Branding → Renamed from "Jump Hip" to "Infinite Hips"

### Technical Architecture Decisions

#### Design System

- **Color Palette**: Dark theme (#0d1117 bg) with lighter pink accents (#ff69b4, #ffb3da)
- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif with clear hierarchy
- **Layout**: Mobile-responsive grid system
- **Inspiration**: User's existing site https://jumpcloud.infinitebutts.com/

#### File Structure Rationale

```

├── index.html              # Main landing page with navigation
├── assets/
│   └── dark-theme.css      # Shared stylesheet for consistency
├── docs/                   # All HTML documentation pages
│   ├── *.html             # Individual medical document pages
│   ├── surgery-support-schedule.html    # Interactive task management
│   ├── pre-surgery-checklist.html       # Countdown & progress tracking
│   └── friends-support-list.html        # Support coordination form
├── images/                 # Original scanned medical documents
└── *.csv                  # Original data files (legacy)
```

#### Technology Choices

- **Static Site**: GitHub Pages for reliability and zero maintenance
- **No Framework**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity and speed
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JS, enhanced with JS
- **Local Storage**: Auto-save functionality for user data persistence

### Key Features Implemented

#### Interactive Tools

1. **Surgery Support Schedule** (`docs/surgery-support-schedule.html`)

   - 79+ tasks from 7 days pre-op through 12+ weeks recovery
   - Filterable by timeline, category, support needs
   - Checkbox tracking with visual progress
   - Color-coded categories for quick scanning

2. **Pre-Surgery Checklist** (`docs/pre-surgery-checklist.html`)

   - Day-by-day breakdown leading to surgery
   - Live countdown timer to surgery date
   - Progress bar showing completion percentage
   - Print-friendly format

3. **Friends & Family Support Coordination** (`docs/friends-support-list.html`)
   - Interactive form for assigning helpers to tasks
   - Auto-save to localStorage
   - Export functionality to CSV
   - Visual indicators for assigned vs unassigned tasks

#### Documentation Pages

- All 7 medical documents converted to accessible HTML
- Cross-referenced with source images
- Consistent navigation and styling
- Mobile-optimized reading experience

### User Experience Considerations

#### Accessibility

- High contrast color scheme for readability
- Large touch targets for mobile devices
- Semantic HTML structure for screen readers
- Print-friendly layouts

#### Usability

- Consistent navigation patterns
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Minimal cognitive load
- Progressive disclosure of information

### Deployment Configuration

#### GitHub Pages Setup

- **Repository**: jeff-hamm/jumphip (originally, may be renamed)
- **Custom Domain**: infinitehips.infinitebutts.com
- **CNAME File**: Configured for Cloudflare integration
- **Jekyll**: Minimal configuration for GitHub Pages compatibility

#### Cloudflare Integration

- DNS CNAME record: infinitehips → jeff-hamm.github.io
- SSL/TLS encryption enabled
- CDN acceleration for global performance

### Development Patterns Used

#### Color Scheme Evolution

1. **Initial**: Standard dark theme
2. **User Feedback**: "black background and pink similar to https://jumpcloud.infinitebutts.com/"
3. **Refinement**: "get rid of the green, make it a lighter pink. Also, the header should be pink letters on a gray background"
4. **Final**: #ff69b4 lighter pink, gray gradient headers with pink text

#### File Naming Conventions

- **HTML Pages**: kebab-case (surgery-support-schedule.html)
- **Assets**: Descriptive names (dark-theme.css)
- **Images**: Original scan naming preserved for traceability

### User Feedback Integration

- **Design**: User provided reference site for color inspiration
- **Functionality**: Evolved from static content to interactive tools
- **Branding**: Changed from "Jump Hip" to "Infinite Hips" per user preference
- **Domain**: Custom domain setup for professional appearance

### Quality Assurance

- **Cross-browser**: Tested responsive design principles
- **Performance**: Optimized images and minimal dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure and documentation
- **Future-proofing**: Standard web technologies for longevity

## Current State

- **Status**: Fully functional website ready for deployment
- **Content**: Complete with all medical documentation and interactive tools
- **Design**: Polished dark theme with pink accents
- **Functionality**: Interactive features with local storage persistence
- **Deployment**: Configured for GitHub Pages with custom domain

## Next Steps for Future Development

1. Consider adding calendar integration for appointment reminders
2. Potential mobile app wrapper for offline access
3. Integration with health tracking APIs if desired
4. Additional export formats (PDF, print optimization)

## Technical Debt & Considerations

- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers only (ES6+ JavaScript)
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage only (not synced across devices)
- **Offline Capability**: Limited to cached pages
- **Scalability**: Static site architecture limits dynamic features

This project successfully transformed from a simple spreadsheet request into a comprehensive digital health companion for surgery recovery.
